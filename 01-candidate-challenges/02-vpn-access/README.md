# VPN access (1)

Hi, promising candidate,

a lot of internal system is accessible only via VPN. You have to install and configure OpenVPN properly. Configuration file can be downloaded from CTFd's link [VPN](https://thecatch.cz/vpn). Activate VPN and visit testing page [http://candidate-test.mysterious-delivery.tcc](http://candidate-test.mysterious-delivery.tcc), where the control code is.

May the Packet be with you!

## Hints

- Do not run more different VPNs at once.
