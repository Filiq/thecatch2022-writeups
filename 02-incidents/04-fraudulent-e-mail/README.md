# Fraudulent e-mail (3)

Hi, packet inspector,

we have a apparently problem with some fraudulent payment gateway (see forwarded e-mail). We suspect that many of our customers have come across this scam.

Identify all card numbers entered into the fraudulent webpage (we have to report incident and its details to CSIRT-TCC).

May the Packet be with you!

## Hints

- Fraudsters never have time for anything, they usually slack off even validating inputs.
