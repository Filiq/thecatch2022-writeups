# Van keys (2)

Hi, packet inspector,

all our delivery vans use password instead of standard car keys. Today, we have found out that the AI has implemented a new security measure â€“ the vans are now referred as "AES Vans" and the password has been changed and encrypted. The decryption part is not yet finished, so we can't start any delivery van since morning!

Good news is that we managed to get the latest version of the decryption script from git repository. Bad news is that the script is not finished yet! Your task is to the finalize the script and decrypt the password as soon as possible.

Download [the script and encrypted password](https://owncloud.cesnet.cz/index.php/s/J6oePmHEplrCXii) (MD5 checksum e67c86a277b0d8001ea5b3e8f6eb6868).

## Hints

- Correct error(s) and add missing part(s).

## Solution

The hint speak for itself, we have to correct and add missing part of [code.py](code.py) file we got, and then decrypt ciphertext we got from [van_keys_enc.aes](van_keys_enc.aes) file.

After fixing the indentation, importing some libraries, adding a txt file that contains the number pi with 1 million digits, we can create a decode function, decrypt the ciphertext and get the flag.
